# Follow all the TODO: (in the code) to deal with this boilerplate 
_You should make a search for commented code lines that contains "TODO:" in the whole project, or use the TODO tool from your IDE)._ <br>
_You can ignore some TODOs in ``/src/assets/`` if you want._ <br>
_You can obviously remove the unused code._

## More mandatory TODOs 

- Import an ICO file in ``/public`` and rename it to ``favicon.ico`` (Replace the existing one).
- Import your assets (fonts, images and icons) in ``/src/assets/``.

## Optional TODOs

- Personalize ``.eslintrc.js`` and ``.eslintignore.js``.
- Resolve warnings (and errors) (Especially about npm dependencies versions).
- Personalize this ``README.md`` file.
- Add an ENV file to use environment variables in your code (Ready to use).

## Scripts / How to start
